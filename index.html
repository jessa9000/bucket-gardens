                The Story of the Buckethead
            </h5>
            <img src="pics/luke_in_snow.jpg" alt="Black dog playing with purple ball in a snowstorm." id="luke">
            <p><small>Photo by Jessica Ealick</small></p>
            <p>
                Our first dog Luke was the best dog ever, and he was a buckethead. He loved playing with his purple ball. 
                When we would come home at the end of the day he would turn in circles one way, then another, then back again and so on. 
                He didn't jump on you, but you knew he was so happy that he couldn't contain himself. 
                Everyone felt happier when Luke was around. 
                That's the kind of dog Luke was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luke helped us meet our cat Fafhrd. There were stray cats living in the neighborhood, and when Luke saw them in the backyard 
                he would chase them away. But Fafhrd was the exception. Luke and Fafhrd became best friends, and when we adopted Fafhrd he started 
                following Luke on our daily walks around the neighborhood. So Luke and Fafhrd became the dog and the cat who took their walks together.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we bought this house Luke was an old boy, but he was still a buckethead. That's why we called this house Bucket Station, and 
                the gardens bear his name as well.
