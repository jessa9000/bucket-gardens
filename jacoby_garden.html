                ~ The Jacoby Garden was named after the late painter Jerry Jacoby of Omaha, Nebraska. 
                His vibrant paintings of geometric landscapes were an inspiration for the original layout of 
                this garden.
                Like Jerry's paintings, the Jacoby Garden finds its own beauty outside the bounds of traditional 
                landscapes. <button id="required-button"><a href="downloads/jacoby_plants.docx" id="required-download" download>

                    Growing Notes:</h3>
                <p>These coreopsis have performed well for several years on a dry slope in spite of having to compete
                    for resources with a lingering stand of Canada thistle. 
                    Late summer performance is affected by powdery mildew. 
                    This year in 2021 we are trying a regime of weekly watering to see if improved culture will 
                    prolong healthy foliage farther into the growing season.</p>

                    Growing Notes:</h3>
                <p>Twenty-one phlox plants were originally planted as a groundcover in the Jacoby Garden. 
                    They have performed extremely well, producing a lovely show of flowers every spring and shading out much of the thistle. 
                    Other weeds such as stoloniferous grasses and spring annuals like deadnettle and hairy bittercress can grow through. 
                    Hardy, drought, and wind-tolerant, the phlox plants growing amidst blue irises and in the lee of a garden bench seem to fare the 
                    best with a small amount of extra protection and moisture.

                <p>A tempting target for browsing deer and groundhogs when young, this shrub needed protection with chicken wire to get it 
                    established. After a couple seasons of growth it was good on its own. We now have it paired with the 'Blueberry Muffin' cultivated 
                    variety to improve fruit set, though it is said to fruit on its own. Give this shrub plenty of room or tend to suckering growth. 
                    We love this shrub... Even though its flowers in May are surprisingly stinky!

                <p>Yarrow varieties come in a wide array of colors. The wild form produces white flowers that are attractive to pollinators. 
                    Although our yarrow has proven to be long-lived in the Jacoby Garden, it grows so quickly and establishes so easily that it is 
                    still a good choice. Some people may consider yarrow to be a weed in turfgrass and other locations, but thanks to a growing 
                    appreciation for wild and native plants, yarrow is growing in popularity.

                    Growing Notes:</h3>
                <p>False indigo is a solid performer among the Eastern native plants that are available in the horticultural trade. 
                    Its only disadvantage is that once established it does self seed freely, and if you don't catch the seedlings in the first year 
                    they can be a bit tricky to dig out. But it is worth it. This plant is so beautiful and boasts scores of flowers for a long 
                    flowering period in spring and early summer. Unfortunately, Japanese stilt grass has started growing under one of my false indigo 
                    plants, and I'm still looking for an easy way to fish it out from amongst the plant's stems.

                    Growing Notes:</h3>
                <p>As its botanical name indicates, this plant is a prostrate ground cover that is one of the few evergreen groundcovers native 
                    to this region. It can be recognized by the distinctive bronze color it turns in winter. This plant was well established 
                    when we bought our house, and we have done nothing but prune it back from time to time. This year I have noticed a small 
                    amount of die-back but I believe it will respond well to pruning. In addition to providing a strong groundcover, this plant 
                    provides cover for many types of wildlife including beneficial garden snakes.
