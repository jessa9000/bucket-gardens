        ~ Trees, shrubs, and woody vines play a large role in the ecosystems they are a part of. 
        Choosing native trees and shrubs is especially important when you are building a wildlife garden 
        due to the many services they provide to other plants and animals. These include food, shade, shelter, soil stabilization, and much more. 
        Many non-native shrubs and trees are unable to provide the same ecosystem services that native trees and shrubs can, 
        due to the fact that they did not evolve along with the local flora and fauna. Here are some examples of the native 
        trees, shrubs, and vines growing at Bucket Gardens. ~

                    <p>Growing Notes: The dwarf fothergilla is one my favorite shrubs. It produces white bottlebrush flowers in the spring, 
                        holds on to attractive foliage throughout summer, and displays the most amazing rainbow colors in fall. 
                        It likes consistent moisture while it is getting established, but after that it is quite drought tolerant. 
                        Fothergilla's leaves are reminiscent of witch hazel, which is in the same family of Hamamelidaceae.</p>

                    <p>Growing Notes: We planted this native tree for the berries it produces that are enjoyed by many different types of wildlife. 
                        Hackberry is also a wind-resistant tree which is important on our windy slope. It is prone to suckering and therefore 
                        may not be best suited to a garden-bed planting, but does well surrounded by grass where any suckers could be easily mown. 
                        A defining character of hackberry is its rough-to-the-touch dentate leaves.</p>

                    <small>Photo by Jessica Ealick</small>
                    <p>Growing Notes: This native honeysuckle is a beautiful woody vine that has attracted humingbirds to our garden. 
                        It and other native honeysuckles are related to the common invasive Japanese honeysuckle from our youth. It is easy to grow. 
                        After having this plant for four years, 2021 is the first time we have seen aphids; hose off for improved appearance. 
                        Coral honeysuckle is also a fun plant to propagate from soft green cuttings.

                    <p>Growing Notes: These flowers are from the Eastern redbud, the first tree we planted when we moved to this house. An understory tree, 
                        redbud can perform well in full sun if it is not allowed to dry out in its first years. Leaf scorch may occur when it is young, 
                        though trees planted in their natural part-shade understory habitat will be easier to establish.
                        Once established, this tree is a low-maintenance winner. Long, dangling seedpods persist into winter and are fun for kids. 
                        Redbud is a harbinger of spring throughout the Eastern US.

                    <p>Growing Notes: We recently planted three small sweetbay shrubs and they have not disappointed. One of their best characters is 
                        the silvery underside of leaves that flicker when the tree is in a breeze. The Southeastern US is a center of genetic diversity for magnolia, 
                        with several important native species found in the region. Sweetbay has the advantage of being a relatively smaller size for homeowners 
                        and produces a magical aroma when it in flower, thus earning its name sweetbay.

                    <small>Photo by Jessica Ealick</small>
                    <p>Growing Notes: This is our Charlie Brown tree -- a white oak who was last on the lot and had lost its leading trunk. 
                        Over the years a secondary branch has risen to take its place as the leader. This white oak was planted in honor of the 
                        famous Maryland Wye Oak that had been killed in a storm several years prior. A slow grower, it is a tree species you nurture for 
                        future generations to enjoy its shade and beauty. When it reaches maturity it will produce acorns of importance to local wildlife.
